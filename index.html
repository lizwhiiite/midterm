		<h1> History </h1>
		<h2> Name </h2>
		<img id="tns" src="tns.png" alt="This is an image of the New School logo.">
		<p id="p2"> From its founding in 1919 by progressive New York educators, and for most of its history, the university was known as <strong>The New School for Social Research.</strong> Between 1997 and 2005 it was known as <strong>New School University</strong>. The university and each of its colleges were renamed in 2005. <br><br> The New School established the University in Exile and the École libre des hautes études in 1933 as a graduate division to serve as an academic haven for scholars escaping from Nazi Germany among other adversarial regimes in Europe.[5] In 1934, the University in Exile was chartered by New York State and its name was changed to the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science. In 2005, it adopted what had initially been the name of the whole institution, the New School for Social Research, while the larger institution was renamed The New School.[6] </p><br>
		<h2> Founding </h2>
		<p> The New School for Social Research was founded by a group of university professors and intellectuals in 1919 as a modern, progressive, free school where adult students could "seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth and present working".[7] Founders included economist and literary scholar Alvin Johnson, historian Charles A. Beard, economists Thorstein Veblen and James Harvey Robinson, and philosophers Horace M. Kallen and John Dewey. Several founders were former professors at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia University" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>. <br><br> In October 1917, after Columbia University imposed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_oath" target="_blank">loyalty oath</a> to the United States upon the entire faculty and student body, it fired several professors. Charles A. Beard, Professor of Political Science, resigned his professorship at Columbia in protest. His colleague James Harvey Robinson resigned in 1919 to join the faculty at the New School. <br><br> The New School plan was to offer the rigorousness of postgraduate education without degree matriculation or degree prerequisites. It was theoretically open to anyone, as the adult division today called Schools of Public Engagement remains.[8] The first classes at the New School took the form of lectures followed by discussions, for larger groups, or as smaller conferences, for "those equipped for specific research". In the first semester, 100 courses, mostly in economics and politics, were offered by an ad hoc faculty that included Thomas Sewall Adams, Charles A. Beard, Horace M. Kallen, Harold Laski, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Thorstein Veblen, James Harvey Robinson, Graham Wallas, Charles B. Davenport, Elsie Clews Parsons, and Roscoe Pound.[9] John Cage later pioneered the subject of Experimental Composition at the school.[10]</p>
		<h2>Motto</h2>
		<p> The New School uses "To the Living Spirit" as its motto. In 1937, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mann" target="_blank">Thomas Mann</a> remarked that a plaque bearing the inscription "be the Living Spirit" had been torn down by the Nazis from a building at the University of Heidelberg. He suggested that the University in Exile adopt that inscription as its motto, to indicate that the 'living spirit,' mortally threatened in Europe, would have a home in this country. Alvin Johnson adopted that idea, and the motto continues to guide the division in its present-day endeavors[11][12]</p>
		<h2> University in Exile</h2>
		<p>The Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science was founded in 1933 as the University in Exile for scholars who had been dismissed from teaching positions by the Italian fascists or had to flee Nazi Germany.[5][13] The University in Exile was initially founded by the director of the New School, Alvin Johnson, through the financial contributions of Hiram Halle and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller Foundation" target="_blank">Rockefeller Foundation</a> The University in Exile and its subsequent incarnations have been the intellectual heart of the New School. Notable scholars associated with the University in Exile include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>psychologists Erich Fromm, Max Wertheimer and Aron Gurwitsch</li>
			<li>political theorists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt" target="_blank">Hannah Arendt</a> and Leo Strauss</li>
			<li>philosopher Hans Jonas.[6]</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In 1934, the University in Exile was chartered by New York State and its name was changed to the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science. In 2005 the Graduate Faculty was again renamed, this time taking the original name of the university, The New School for Social Research.[6]</p>
